# HUJI Image Processing (67829)

My solutions for all the exercises for the Image Processing course (67829) of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2024-2025 Fall Semester.

If you're a fellow HUJI student who didn't complete the course - You're highly encouraged to exit this repository and solve everything by your own. I am in no way responsible for any outcome of using this code for your academics, whether you're HUJI student or not - Use at your own risk.

Note: Exercise 4 is partial, with the Dynamic Panorama being only an attempt, without a properly working example.
